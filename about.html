					They followed it up with three more ground breaking videos Directed by Chothira
					Shanaka of CS Creations . Shanaka's creativity in "Pahasara" "Oba Ekwenawado" and
					"Ranwan Mal Dam" made CENTIGRADZ rule the Video Charts for 15 straight weeks in
					2008 .Riding the high waves of success; CENTIGRADZ were sorted out by the movie
					moguls to produce the theme song of the movie Heart FM and a mid tempo ballad for
					the movie "Asai Man Piyabanna" directed by Udayakantha . They endorsed and started
					production in 2008. The group also appeared in the movie "Heart Fm" directed by
